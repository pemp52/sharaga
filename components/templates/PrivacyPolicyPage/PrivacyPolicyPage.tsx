              access, collect, store, process, use, disclose or transfer your

              your personal information on our behalf. In some cases, other
              policies apply to you. It may be the case when you use certain

              these other policies while using the products or services they
              apply to. Such policies will supersede this privacy policy unless
              they expressly refer to it. This privacy policy does not cover

                partners, such as our franchisees and licensees or social media,
                could also determine "why" and "how" your personal information
                is used. They have their own privacy and cookies policies, so
                remember that the personal information you give them will be

                legislation. The processing of your personal information will
                comply with your privacy legislation and rely on the legal bases
                set out in this section. The legal bases listed in this section
                will also apply when we share your data with third parties (as
                listed in the section With whom do we share your personal
                information?) for the purposes mentioned below. If you would

                contact us at privacy@balenciaga.com (or see How can you contact

                To manage your Balenciaga profile. Once you have requested us to
                create your Balenciaga profile, via Balenciaga websites or any
                other means, including our customer service, your personal
                information will be linked to this profile, where we will keep
                all the information we have on you. This could include personal
                information we obtain directly from you as well as from other
                sources in accordance with applicable legislation. This could
                also include information about the purchases made when checking
                out as a guest or when checking out using a profile. The
                information in your Balenciaga profile is crucial to provide you
                with the Balenciaga personalized and tailored experience, and in
                some cases is necessary in order to access to some specific
                services or to purchase from our website, and thus it needs to

                contact you, we want to provide you with relevant and tailored
                customer service. For this purpose of providing you the
                Balenciaga experience, we will collect, store, process, use,
                disclose and transfer your personal information and other

            <ol>
              <p>
                Our general approach is to retain your personal information only
                for as long as it is needed. When you have a Balenciaga profile,
                a temporary record or subscribe to our newsletters, we generally
                retain your personal information for 5 years from the last
                interaction you initiated with us. When you interact with our
                customer services, we generally retain the recordings of the
                calls for 40 days (unless a longer retention period is permitted
                by law), and the other personal information you have shared with
                us (including personal information shared by mail, chat or text
                message or when our interaction is transcribed) for 5 years from
                the last interaction you initiated with us. We may retain
                personal information for a shorter or longer time, for instance,
                where we are obliged to do so in accordance with relevant legal,
                tax and accounting requirements.
